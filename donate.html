<!-- 
	Hi Krissy!  I included feedback on your code in HTML comments like this one.

	Overall, great job with the form!  The HTML structure is great - I just have a few comments 
	around the radio buttons (see them inline).

	Also, regarding styling, you can always make all of your form elements block elements (using 
	display: block in your CSS) to make the form look a little nicer.

				For radio buttons, all of the buttons in a particular group - in this case, all
				the buttons for different donation amounts - need to have the same name in the 
				name attribute.  What you are using as the name, you should use as the value
				attribute.

				The value attribute is how the backend knows what amount the user
				selected.

				The name attribute is how the HTML knows all of the radio buttons belong to
				the same group, which is what forces the user to only be able to pick one.

				Also, all of the radio buttons should be children of the same label tag.

				Example:

				<label for="donations">
					Please select donation amount
					<input type="radio" name="donations" value="25">$25</option>
					<input type="radio" name="donations" value="50">$50</option>
					<input type="radio" name="donations" value="75">$75</option>
				</label>
			-->
			<label for="donations">Please select donation amount</label>
				<label>
					<input type="radio" name="$25">$25</option>
				</label>
				<label>
					<input type="radio" name="$50">$50</option>
				</label>
				<label>
					<input type="radio" name="$100">$100</option>
				</label>
				<label>
					<input type="radio" name="$500">$500</option>
				</label>
				</input>
			
			<!-- 
				Don't forget to use the <label> tag to label this password field, just like you did
				with the first name and last name fields.  For example:

				<label for="password">Password</label>
				<input type="password" name="password" id="password">
			-->
			<input type="password">Password</input>

			<!--
				Instead of wrapping the submit button in an <a> tag, you should
				use Javascript to redirect the page to another page (which I just
				realized we did not quite go over page redirection).

				The <a> tag around your button is also why your validation JS is not running.

				You can use the submit event to listen for when the user submits the form
				and then do whatever it needs to do and then take the user to the thank you page.

				So... in the JS file:

				$('form').submit(processForm);

				function processForm() {
					// Do whatever you need to do with the form.

					// Then go to the thank you page.
					window.location.assign('thanks.html');
				}

				See my comments in the JS file too.

			<a href="thanks.html">Submit donation!
				<button type="submit" value="Submit donation!"></button>
			</a>
